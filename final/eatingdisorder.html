	<p>I personally struggle with BED (Binge Eating Disorder), as far as i can remember it started when i was very young. But i wasn't aware of the fact that it wasn't normal to eat without stopping. My awareness started taking place at the beginning of the pandemic,Covid-19, when everybody was confined at home.While we were all confining at home i saw the way my eating habits were, before because of school and my lifestyle i never really paid attention to my eating style until i stayed home,i constantly needed something in my mouth to eat or chew, like an obsession. That's how i did my research and found out the disorder i had, i tried to stop but i physically can't, till today i have a constant battle in my head of knowing when to stop eating.Because of that my weight fluctuates a lot. For a moment , or some months i can hold back but after that i would just burts into a beast who never ate, during the middle of the night.</p>

<p>An eating disorder is a serious mental illness that is characterized by abnormal eating habits and behaviors that can have a negative impact on a person's physical and mental health. There are several types of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder, among others.The causes of eating disorders are complex and can vary from person to person. However, some common factors that can contribute to the development of an eating disorder include genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. For example, a family history of eating disorders or mental illness, social and cultural pressures to maintain a certain body weight or appearance, and low self-esteem or a negative body image can all increase the risk of developing an eating disorder.In addition, traumatic life experiences, such as physical or sexual abuse, can also be a contributing factor. Some individuals may use disordered eating behaviors as a way to cope with difficult emotions or as a means of control in their lives. Others may have a distorted perception of their body shape and weight, which can lead to extreme dieting, over-exercising, or other harmful behaviors.Regardless of the specific cause, eating disorders can have serious physical and psychological consequences, including malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal problems, depression, anxiety, and even death. Therefore, it is essential that individuals who may be struggling with an eating disorder seek professional help as soon as possible. With appropriate treatment and support, individuals with eating disorders can learn to develop healthy eating habits and behaviors, improve their mental health and well-being, and achieve a better quality of life.</p>
