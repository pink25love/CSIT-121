<h1> As a girl, </h1>
<h3> once you enter puberty you're not viewed as innocent anymore by society. Which leaves you unprotected by both men and women, men sexualizing you and women pouring their hatred towards themself right to you with jealousy and wishing they could be you. So you're basically on your own from that moment. During my puberty at the beginnning I still didn't realize what was happening to me but when my african mom trew a party to celebrate my menstruation when I was 11 years old, that's when I was like oh oh I don't think it's a good sign. From that moment I couldn't play with who I wanted to play because "now I am a women I can't be hanging out with men", I need to close my legs when I sit , I shouldn't eat too much, I should wear dresses,etc. The list was long but deep within me I was so lost because my body was changing, and preteenagers can be very mean and heartless. I started having stretch marks as far as I could remember, and I started being so insecure of them especially the ones on my arms, those were the ones you could "see". And I remember never wearing t-shirts or always wearing a cardigan when I was wearing something that reveal my arm. My mom would always scream at me during the summer asking me why was I wearing those type of clothes when it was literally burning outside and I would just let her talk to herself and never answer her. I also started comparing myself to my other peers and was so jealous of these skinny girls, that could wear shorts to school without their thighs touching. During my middle school years I started cutting myself and had so much suicidal thoughts , I remember that one night I took a knife in the kitchen, went to the bathroom watched myself in the mirror while taking the knife and using the pointy part to put on my navel and pressing hard to see if it could hurt me. One day my mom saw my scars on my arms , looked at me dead in the eyes and laughed. Mental health is a taboo matter in african culture people just disregard it and use religion or their values to back up why they don't believe in mental health. Anyways i eventually stopped cutting myself and moved to a new middle school because my previous one was closed by my city , because it was seen as too "ghetto", whatever in that new middle school I met one girl, and she changed my life.

<h1> Dieynaba,</h1>
<h3> God knows how much I love this girl , she was the one who taught me how to love myself, taught me about self-esteem. I met Dieynaba in the new class I was assigned to at my new middle school. She was the only black girl in my class so immediately I was drawn to her but she didn't like me. So I eventually stopped trying to be friend with her but I think she felt guilty so when I stopped trying she was now the one trying to be friend with me so we started hanging out together. And one day we had a conversation and since that conversation we became very close. While our teacher was proclamed sick we add to wait in class for the person that was supossed to take replace him. So that's how I opened myself to her and she opened herself to me and we had so much similarities too we were both chubby girls. Anyways, she started telling me how she started loving herself regardless of the fact she was bullied, she gave me youtube videos to watch of young chubby women of color influencers, who preach about loving yourself. Immediately after that day I started dressing more womanish, stopped hiding my body and stopped caring about what other people who'd say about me or my body , and I even started wearing makeup. It was just like she switched on my potential, you know they always say there's some people that are put in your life for a special purpose well I think her purpose in my life was to make me see my potential and how pretty I am.</h3>
<h1> So girls,</h1>
<h3> no matter what you may be going trough , always make sure to love yourself and treat yourself like you're the most flavorful candy in the whole world. Surrond yourself with people who see your worth and your beauty. </h3>
