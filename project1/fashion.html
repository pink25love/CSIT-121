<p>*** Growing up , I was a chubby girl and i was really insecure about my body, so i didin't like wearing clothes that would reveal the stretch marks i had on my arms or my thighs that were rubbing against each other. So the only type of clothing i could found myself wearing was men clothes. Tracksuits, sweatpants etc... till it even became my personality and i was seen has a tomboy. Then in high school i started caring more about my appearance but it was always temporary because my peers would make fun of what i wear and my style sense. So i abandonned it , till i entered college and started dressing hyperfeminine, and caring less about what people might think of my way of dressing. It made me realize that i cared so much about how i looked like so i prefered negliging myself than not be the fashionista i would want to be. Now i enjoy looking at myself in the mirror with different outfits , with all my closet on the floor while searching for the shoes that would be adeqate for my outfit,wearing stuff that show my strech marks or are short without a care in the world. And my mom in the process of me finding a outfit shouting that i should arrange my room, its all part of the experience of being a girl, calling my friends and telling them about the next outfit i intended wearing, or to go shop together or matching with my besties.ðŸ’‹</p></div>
