<p> This is Yasmin Dog, a friend of mine, I really love animals but I am not allowed to have some at home, because we live in a appartement and my grandma don't like animals üòê. The only animal my mom decided we could have at homes were fishes but they died :/. So i always love going to my friend house to play with her dog. One day CCBC brought friendly dogs that relieved stress for students so my friend and i went there and played with them. </p>
